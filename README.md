Here is a list of the coding projects and workshops I completed during the Christmas break.

* COMPLETED PURE FUNCTION UNIT TESTING WORKSHOP
    I was also able to produce a successful solution to the palindrome function challenge. This was something I started but didn't finish at the time.

* ADDED A 'RETURN TO TOP' BUTTON WITH CSS SCROLL-BEHAVIOUR ON WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENT

* COMPLETED LOCAL STORAGE WORKSHOP (WEEK 3)

* FIXED ISSUE WITH NON-FUNCTIONING GUESTBOOK, WEEK 4 ASSIGNMENT
    Now fully functional with like count button on each comment, the main issue was with the Render deployment so I re-deployed. There was also a couple of coding mistakes. Render or Supabase takes a while to respond and display the comments, I guess this is just the way it works?

* CHRISTMAS CODING PROJECT
    I created an annoying Christmas themed project and deployed on Github.
    I used event handlers and most of the page was built with DOM manipulation. I made use of a function that I wrote a while ago to create html elements on the page. This was adapted to create form elements used in the project. There is also a function to remove html elements, a function with callback, timers to delay DOM manipulation and I made use of local storage to store user data from form inputs. There is also a randomizer function with variable multiplication factor parameter.
    Unfortunately, I couldn't get audio to work on the project, possibly something to do with autoplay and the browser but this needs looking into another time.
